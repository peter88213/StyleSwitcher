<p>This extension provides a toolbar with buttons to quickly switch between the style sheets of different document templates. However, unlike the <a href="https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/template-changer">Template Changer</a> extension, StyleSwitcher does not associate the template with the document. The point of quickly switching styles is to get a view optimized for the screen or for printing or for other purposes, such as standard manuscript page counting.</p>

<h3>Please note:</h3>

<p>If this extension is to be of any use to you, you must understand the concept of document templates and styles. If this seems new to you, you might want to take a look at this <a href = "https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Writer_Guide/Introduction_to_Styles">introduction on the OpenOffice Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>This extension requires three document templates to be located in the <strong>template</strong> folder of your OpenOffice user profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Default.ott</strong>  (optimized for screen display)</li>
  <li><strong>StandardPages.ott</strong>  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_manuscript_format">standard manuscript format</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Printout.ott</strong>  (optimized for print output)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must provide these templates yourself. Sample template documents for customization can be downloaded <a href="https://peter88213.github.io/StyleSwitcher/samples">here</a>.</p>
