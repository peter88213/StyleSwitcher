This extension provides a toolbar with buttons to quickly switch between the style sheets of different document templates. 
However, unlike the [_Template Changer_](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/template-changer) extension,  _StyleSwitcher_  does not associate the template with the document. The point of quickly switching styles is to get a view optimized for the screen or for printing or for other purposes, such as standard manuscript page counting.
